# Do-Retail-Investors-need-Analysts-Recommendations

This repository provides the Python and STATA codes for our analysis for the Capstone project: Do Retail Investors Need Analystsâ€™ Recommendations?
We have uploaded the cleaned datasets, on which the STATA DO file runs. However, the imported datasets for the Python script from I/B/E/S and CRSP are very large and are available upon request.
